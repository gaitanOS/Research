This thesis research project involved the building of a large dodecacopter, approximately 8ft x 8ft in size.

My primary work involved:
-C programming to connect the Pixhawk drone flight microcontroller to a FLIR Duo R.
-JavaScript programming for web flight planning UI.
-Photostitching from aerial flight missions.

The purpose of the drone was to carry out aerial photography missions over dry fields. 
The FLIR camera could take thermal imaging at various waypoints along a flight path.
These images could be stitched together to get a larger singular photo of the entire field and identify hotspots in soil that imply needed water irrigation.
The drone is capable of heavy payloads, possibly a water sprayer, to properly water hotspots when identified from the initial flight missions.
